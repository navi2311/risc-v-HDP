    - Verify all the C code (counter, matrix multiplication, ALU code) using RISC-V compiler and spike output.
    Note: all c program are available in 

      1) [Counter](../week1/part_a/counter.c)
      
      2) [Matrix Multiplication](../week1/part_a/matrix_multiplication.c)
      
      3) [ALU](../week1/part_a/alu.c)
      
    ## Measure CPU performance of all the programs mentioned above using either Godbolt or RISC-V disassembler.
