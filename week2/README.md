### 1) Understanding how to measure CPU performance


### 2) RISC-V architecture


### 3) Task

####  Verify all the C code (counter, matrix multiplication, ALU code) using RISC-V compiler and spike output.

Note: all C programs are available in 

1) [Counter](../week1/part_a/counter.c)

2) [Matrix Multiplication](../week1/part_a/matrix_mul.c)

3) [ALU](../week1/part_b/alu.c)

####  RISCV Compiler
    
#### Measure CPU performance of all the programs mentioned above using either Godbolt or RISC-V disassembler.
