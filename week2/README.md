    - Verify all the C code (counter, matrix multiplication, ALU code) using RISC-V compiler and spike output.
    Note: all c program are avaliable in [week1_parta](https://github.com/navi2311/risc-v-HDP/tree/main/week1/part_a)

      1) Counter
      
      2) Matrix Multiplication
      
      3) ALU
      
    ## Measure CPU performance of all the programs mentioned above using either Godbolt or RISC-V disassembler.
