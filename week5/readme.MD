This week, we focused on developing a Custom RISC-V core tailored to run PILL application. 

### Tasks Completed



 **Chip Configuration File - all.json**:
    - Created the `all.json` configuration file to generate the chipron processor code for the custom RISC-V core.

 **Processor Core and Testbench Generation**:
    - Generated the processor core along with the testbench using the chipron processor code generated from `all.json`.





RESULT:
