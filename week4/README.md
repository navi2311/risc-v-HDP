In week 4, i have  learned about interacting with hardware components using low-level programming techniques, particularly using inline assembly language within C code. 
1. learned how to interact with hardware components such as a buzzer and a button using inline assembly language within C code.
2. This involved writing inline assembly snippets to manipulate hardware registers directly, enabling control over the buzzer state and reading the status of a button.


Note:changed user defined time to 5 min.for initial.once i checked all other hardware interface i will add an interface to the user to set the time.
