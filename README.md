The Product Based RISC-V Skilling Program is a  six-week course that embarks on a journey through the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), aimed at providing both a theoretical foundation and hands-on experience.


  

  ## Week0
  1. overview of the course and installed vdi file.
 

  ## Week1 
  1. representation of negative numbers using signed,1's complement and 2's complement and problems have been revised.
  2. Assignment : C code to assembly level
  3. execute a c program  using gcc complier and convert into assemble by riscv complier
  4. debug the instructions using spike simulator.
  5. 

  ## [Week2](week2)
  1. Cpu performace
  2. RISC-V architecture
  3. coverted c porgrams using riscv gcc complier and cal the performace

  ## [week3](week3)
  1. Application in c program-pill dispenser.
  2. tested the functionality of app using riscv toolchain.

## [Week4](week4)
1. In these week we will control the gpio register to mainpluate the senor data 
2. generate a custom based riscv using [chipcron](https://chipcron-pvt-ltd.github.io/webpage/index.html)

## [WEEK5](WEEK5)
1. verilog simulation and verification of riscv.

## [week6](week6)
1.   bypassing uart
2.   synthesis
